# OL7
My first repository as part of the Mozilla OL7 programme

This is also my first readme :) 

After chatting with my amazing mentor, Sarah, I've come up with some personal and project goals and used those to develop my vision statements:

Personal: I'm working with my lab and colleagues at the Centre for eResearch to create a how-to manual so that my lab and any other can work more openly and transparently at every stage of the research cycle.

Project (this one is aspirational..): I'm working with interested individuals, researchers, community groups, social enterprises, and NGOs to build a community that will challenge the paradigm for how scientific research is done.
